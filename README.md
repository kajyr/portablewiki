# portablewiki
A portable, filesystem based wiki system.

The idea is to have a lightweight wiki system that lives on the local filesystem,
for example to store confidential or sensible data that might not fit on the cloud.

I wanted a tool that could save file on the HD in a readable format
like [DokuWiki on a Stick](https://www.dokuwiki.org/install:dokuwiki_on_a_stick) 
without having to use a webserver.
